## Model
We will model the probability of a Canadian feeling satisfied about life as whole based on a set of given factors using Logistic Regression. 

Let $p$ = the probability of a Canadian feeling satisfied, where "feeling satisfied" is determined if an individual rates their feeling about life as a whole greater than 8. Then our GLM will be formulated as the following: 
$$
\log({\frac{p}{1-p}}) = \beta_0 + \sum^{K}_{i=1}\beta_ix_i
$$
.
Define K
