#### Preamble ####
# Purpose: The purpose of this code is to clean-up the 2017 GSS data obtained 
# from the U of T library. That data is available to U of T students, but it needs 
# to be put into a tidy format before it can be analysed. This code does that.
# The main issue is that the data are released with codes for variables, whereas,
# we want the variable. e.g. sex is 1 or 2, but we want sex is female or male. (This
# sounds trite in that case, but gets more difficult with more involved variables.)
# So we create a dictionary type dataset that has the variable names and their 
# possible values. In that we embed some R code that will do a replacement. We 
# then apply that dataset to the raw dataset. Finally we do all the usual cleaning.
# to the dataset. You will end up with a dataset called gss.csv.

# Pre-reqs: You need to have downloaded the data from the library. To do that: 
## 1. Go to: http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/
## 2. Data centre --> UofT users or http://dc.chass.utoronto.ca/myaccess.html
## 3. Click SDA @ CHASS, should redirect to sign in. Sign in.
## 4. Continue in English (you're welcome to use the French, but we probably can't
## help you too much).
## 5. Crtl F GSS, click
## 6. Click "Data" on the one you want. We used 2017, but you may want a different 
## wave. In particular the General Social Survey on social identity (cycle 27), 
## 2013 has some variables on voter participation if you're into that sort of 
## thing. You're welcome to pick any year but this code applies to 2017.
## 7. Click download
## 8. Select CSV data file, data definitions for STATA (gross, but stick with it for now).
## 9. Can select all variables by clicking button next to green colored "All". Then continue.
## 10. Create the files, download and save
# Check: 
## You WILL need to change the raw data name. Search for .csv - line 41
## You may need to adjust the filepaths depending on your system. Search for: read_
