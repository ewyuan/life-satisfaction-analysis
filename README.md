### Potential Ideas
* ~~Multiple models related to Income all connected to each other~~

#### Variables we can run regression on.
* Variable Name: VISMIN and SLM_01 - Visible minority status of the respondent and Feelings about life as a whole.
* Variable Name: BRTHPRVC and SLM_01 - Province or territory of birth and Feelings about life as a whole.
* Variable Name: UWS_230 and SLM_01 - Usual work schedule description and Feelings about life as a whole.
* Variable Name: FAMINCG2 and SLM_01 - Family income - Total (before tax) and Feelings about life as a whole.
* Variable Name: DWELC and SLM_01 - Dwelling type of the respondent and Feelings about life as a whole.

### Questionnaire for 2017 data
Link is [here](https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3Instr.pl?Function=assembleInstr&lang=en&Item_Id=335815)

#### N for Target Population
Number of people 15 years old or older = 30633177 (https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710000501)
- 30633177/36545295 = 0.8382249206 Proportion of 15yo or older in 2017

Number of people in 10 provinces in Q3 2017 = 36423159 (https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710000901&cubeTimeFrame.startMonth=01&cubeTimeFrame.startYear=2017&cubeTimeFrame.endMonth=10&cubeTimeFrame.endYear=2017&referencePeriods=20170101%2C20171001)

Assumming the proportion of 15 yo or older in 2017 is the same across the country, then 36423159*.0.8382249206 = **30530800**
